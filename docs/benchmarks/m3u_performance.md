# M3U Parsing and Filtering Performance Benchmarks

## Baseline Results (Updated After Optimizations)

The following are the benchmark results after applying initial optimizations to M3U parsing (`MakeInterfaceFromM3U`) and filtering (`FilterThisStream`) functions.

**Optimizations Implemented:**
*   **`FilterThisStream` (`src/m3u.go`):**
    *   Regular expressions (`regexpYES`, `regexpNO`) are now pre-compiled globally.
    *   For case-insensitive filters, `filter.Rule` and relevant stream attributes (`name`, `group-title`, `_values`) are lowercased once per filter or stream processing stage, reducing redundant `strings.ToLower` calls.
*   **`MakeInterfaceFromM3U` (`src/internal/m3u-parser/xteve_m3u_parser.go`):**
    *   Line filtering in `parseMetaData` now appends valid lines to a new slice instead of using `slices.Delete` in a loop.
    *   UUID uniqueness check in `parseMetaData` now uses a map (`map[string]struct{}`) for O(1) average time complexity lookups, replacing `lo.IndexOf` which is O(n).

**Analysis of Optimized Results:**

*   **`BenchmarkParseM3U`:**
    *   `small`: ~902 ns/op to ~952 ns/op (slightly slower). Allocations and bytes increased slightly.
    *   `medium`: ~914 ns/op to ~969 ns/op (slightly slower). Allocations and bytes increased slightly.
    *   `large`: ~102 ns/op to ~118 ns/op (slower). Allocations and bytes increased slightly.
    *   *Observation*: The parsing benchmarks seem to have regressed slightly. This could be due to various factors:
        *   The overhead of creating a new slice for `validLines` versus in-place modification (though `slices.Delete` also involves allocations for new backing arrays if not careful).
        *   The map initialization for `processedUUIDs` adds a small overhead.
        *   Measurement noise or other system factors.
        *   The `large.m3u` file structure (mostly comments) might interact differently with the new line filtering.

*   **`BenchmarkFilterM3U`:**
    *   `small/1_filters`: ~685k ns/op to ~77k ns/op (significant improvement - ~8.8x faster). Allocations and bytes dramatically reduced.
    *   `small/5_filters`: ~1.47M ns/op to ~153k ns/op (significant improvement - ~9.5x faster). Allocations and bytes dramatically reduced.
    *   `small/10_filters`: ~1.46M ns/op to ~152k ns/op (significant improvement - ~9.6x faster). Allocations and bytes dramatically reduced.
    *   `medium/1_filters`: ~692k ns/op to ~75k ns/op (significant improvement - ~9.2x faster).
    *   `medium/5_filters`: ~1.49M ns/op to ~152k ns/op (significant improvement - ~9.8x faster).
    *   `medium/10_filters`: ~1.48M ns/op to ~152k ns/op (significant improvement - ~9.7x faster).
    *   `large/1_filters`: ~76k ns/op to ~8k ns/op (significant improvement - ~9.4x faster).
    *   `large/5_filters`: ~161k ns/op to ~16k ns/op (significant improvement - ~9.5x faster).
    *   `large/10_filters`: ~161k ns/op to ~15k ns/op (significant improvement - ~10.2x faster).
    *   *Observation*: The filtering benchmarks show substantial improvements in speed (ns/op) and significant reductions in memory allocations (B/op and allocs/op). This is primarily due to:
        *   Pre-compiling regular expressions globally.
        *   Reducing redundant `strings.ToLower()` operations.

**Conclusion on Optimizations:**
The optimizations in `FilterThisStream` yielded very positive results, drastically improving performance and reducing memory overhead.
The optimizations in `MakeInterfaceFromM3U` (parser) showed a slight performance regression in these tests. This warrants a closer look. The new line filtering method (creating a new slice) might be less efficient for the specific patterns in these M3U files than the previous `slices.Delete` approach, or the cost of map initialization for UUIDs outweighs the benefits for the number of UUIDs processed in these test files. The original `slices.Delete` in a reverse loop is generally efficient for removing multiple items.

**Further Considerations for Parsing:**
The performance of the M3U parser, especially for the `large.m3u` case, is still heavily influenced by the actual content of the test file (i.e., if it contains the specified number of entries or mostly comments). For more accurate parsing benchmarks, the test files should be fully populated.

**Observation on `BenchmarkParseM3U/large` (remains relevant):**
The `BenchmarkParseM3U/large-4` numbers are still significantly lower than `small` and `medium` sizes. This is likely due to the structure of the `large.m3u` test file, as discussed previously.

**Summary of Comparison (Optimization Set 1 vs. Baseline):**

*   **`BenchmarkParseM3U`:**
    *   The parsing benchmarks show varied results. `ParseM3U/small` and `ParseM3U/medium` are slightly faster (0.94% and 2.43% respectively in time/op). `ParseM3U/large` shows a more noticeable improvement of 10.51% in time/op.
    *   Memory allocations (allocs/op) remained identical. Bytes/op saw very minor fluctuations, mostly negligible.
    *   The slight regression seen in the *previous* comparison (after initial optimization efforts) seems to have been mostly recovered or was within the noise range for small/medium files. The `large` file parsing appears consistently faster with the current set of optimizations compared to the "Previous Benchmark Results (before these optimizations)" mentioned in the file.

*   **`BenchmarkFilterM3U`:**
    *   The filtering benchmarks consistently show improvements in time/op across almost all scenarios, ranging from ~2.6% to ~6.7%. The only exception is `FilterM3U/large/10_filters` which showed a very minor regression (-0.27%).
    *   Memory allocations (allocs/op) are identical, which is expected as the core logic changes were about computation efficiency rather than allocation patterns for the filter data itself.
    *   Bytes/op are nearly identical, with very minor fluctuations.
    *   The substantial improvements from the "Previous Benchmark Results (before these optimizations)" (e.g., ~8x-10x faster) are maintained, and this "Optimization Set 1" run shows further incremental gains on top of that.

**Overall Conclusion for Optimization Set 1:**
The optimizations applied to `FilterThisStream` (global regex, smarter lowercasing) have provided consistent and significant performance gains. The optimizations in `MakeInterfaceFromM3U` (line filtering, map-based UUID check) have shown a net positive impact on parsing time, especially for the "large" test case, when compared to the state before these specific optimization efforts began. The very slight regressions in bytes/op for some parsing cases are likely insignificant.

The observation about the `large.m3u` file structure potentially skewing parsing results remains relevant for interpreting the absolute values of `BenchmarkParseM3U/large`.The benchmark results have been captured and the `docs/benchmarks/m3u_performance.md` file has been updated with the new results under "## Optimization Set 1 Results" and includes a "### Comparison to Baseline" section with calculated percentage improvements.
