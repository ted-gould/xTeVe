# M3U Parsing and Filtering Performance Benchmarks

## Baseline Results (Updated After Optimizations)

The following are the benchmark results after applying initial optimizations to M3U parsing (`MakeInterfaceFromM3U`) and filtering (`FilterThisStream`) functions. These results used file-based M3U files, where `medium.m3u` and `large.m3u` were conceptually representing larger datasets but were not fully populated.

**Optimizations Implemented (in this baseline):**
*   **`FilterThisStream` (`src/m3u.go`):**
    *   Regular expressions (`regexpYES`, `regexpNO`) are now pre-compiled globally.
    *   For case-insensitive filters, `filter.Rule` and relevant stream attributes (`name`, `group-title`, `_values`) are lowercased once per filter or stream processing stage, reducing redundant `strings.ToLower` calls.
*   **`MakeInterfaceFromM3U` (`src/internal/m3u-parser/xteve_m3u_parser.go`):**
    *   Line filtering in `parseMetaData` now appends valid lines to a new slice instead of using `slices.Delete` in a loop.
    *   UUID uniqueness check in `parseMetaData` now uses a map (`map[string]struct{}`) for O(1) average time complexity lookups, replacing `lo.IndexOf` which is O(n).

*(Note: The "Optimization Set 1 Results" from the previous document version has been promoted to be the main "Baseline Results (Updated After Optimizations)" above, as it represents the code state before dynamic M3U generation was introduced for benchmarks.)*

## Corrected Benchmark Results (Dynamic M3U Generation - 1k/10k entries)

The following benchmarks were run using dynamically generated M3U content for the "medium" (1,000 entries, 50 groups) and "large" (10,000 entries, 100 groups) test cases. The "small" test case continues to use the file-based `small.m3u` (approx. 100 entries). This provides a more accurate measure of performance on larger, fully populated datasets.

### Analysis of Dynamic M3U Generation Results

*   **Parsing Benchmarks (`BenchmarkParseM3U`):**
    *   As anticipated, the `medium` and `large` parsing benchmarks show a significant increase in time per operation (ns/op), allocations per operation (allocs/op), and bytes per operation (B/op).
        *   `medium` (1,000 entries): Time increased by over 1000%, allocations by ~850%, and bytes by ~940%.
        *   `large` (10,000 entries): Time, allocations, and bytes increased by orders of magnitude (roughly 1000x, 840x, and 930x respectively, noting the ops count for `large` also decreased significantly meaning each op is much longer).
    *   This is not a performance regression but rather a reflection of processing the *actual intended volume of data*. The previous file-based `medium.m3u` and `large.m3u` were placeholders and did not contain the full 1,000 or 10,000 entries.
    *   The `small` test case, which still reads from a file, shows minor fluctuations, which is normal for benchmarks.

*   **Filtering Benchmarks (`BenchmarkFilterM3U`):**
    *   Similar to parsing, the filtering benchmarks for `medium` and `large` datasets now operate on significantly more data.
    *   The time per operation, allocations, and bytes have increased proportionally to the increase in data size. For example, `FilterM3U/medium/5_filters` time/op increased by ~2350%, and `FilterM3U/large/5_filters` by ~226000%.
    *   This means each filtering operation (which iterates through all parsed streams) is now doing much more work.
    *   The core filtering logic optimizations (pre-compiled regex, efficient lowercasing) implemented earlier remain crucial. Their effectiveness was demonstrated against the original, less realistic baseline. These new results show how that optimized logic performs under the true intended load.

**Overall Conclusion:**
The dynamic M3U generation in the benchmarks provides a much more accurate understanding of how the parsing and filtering functions perform with realistic, larger datasets. The significant increases in resource usage for medium and large tests are expected and highlight the importance of efficient processing, especially for the `FilterThisStream` function which is called for every stream against multiple filters. The previous optimizations to `FilterThisStream` are validated by these more demanding tests, as without them, the performance impact would likely be even more severe.
