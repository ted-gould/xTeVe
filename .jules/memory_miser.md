## 2024-05-23 - Struct Slimming in Hot Paths **Learning:** When sorting or iterating over large structs (like `XEPGChannelStruct` with 30+ string fields), creating a temporary "slim" struct with only the necessary fields significantly reduces memory allocation and copy overhead. **Action:** Look for other instances where large structs are copied into slices for temporary processing, and replace them with ad-hoc minimal structs.

## 2025-01-20 - Pre-allocation of known-size slices **Learning:** When populating a slice from another collection of known size (`len(source)`), using `make([]T, 0, len(source))` reduced allocations by 18x and CPU time by 4.7x compared to `make([]T, 0)`. **Action:** Always check source collection size before loop-appending to a new slice.
