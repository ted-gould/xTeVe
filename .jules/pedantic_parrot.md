## 2025-05-24 - Adopted cmp.Compare for float sorting **Learning:** `cmp.Compare(a, b)` treats NaN as less than any non-NaN value and equal to other NaNs, whereas naive `if a < b ...` blocks treat NaN as incomparable (false for both < and >), effectively treating it as equal to everything in a sort context (often leading to unstable or undefined sort behavior). **Action:** Always prefer `cmp.Compare` for sorting floats to ensure deterministic behavior with NaNs.
