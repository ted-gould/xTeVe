## 2025-05-24 - Adopted cmp.Compare for float sorting **Learning:** `cmp.Compare(a, b)` treats NaN as less than any non-NaN value and equal to other NaNs, whereas naive `if a < b ...` blocks treat NaN as incomparable (false for both < and >), effectively treating it as equal to everything in a sort context (often leading to unstable or undefined sort behavior). **Action:** Always prefer `cmp.Compare` for sorting floats to ensure deterministic behavior with NaNs.

## 2026-01-23 - MIME Type Parameters with mime.TypeByExtension **Learning:** `mime.TypeByExtension` returns the full media type including parameters (e.g., `text/html; charset=utf-8`), whereas simple custom switches often return only the type/subtype. Direct string equality checks (e.g., `ctype == "text/html"`) will fail with the standard library return values. **Action:** Always use `mime.ParseMediaType` (or prefix checks) when validating content types returned by the standard library to handle parameters robustly.
